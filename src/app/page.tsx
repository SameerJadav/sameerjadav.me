          Hey there! I&apos;m Sameer Jadav, a 19 y/o from India. I am into
          programming, VFX, CGI and creative coding—it&apos;s like blending art
          and tech, it&apos;s awesome! Exploring and figuring things out about
          myself is another thing I enjoy.

          Not too long ago, I used to spend hours immersed in anime. But one
          day, a friend generously offered me his old laptop since he was
          upgrading. With this awesome new device, I decided to ditch the anime
          binges and dive into learning some serious skills. That&apos;s when I
          discovered programming, especially web development. I started with
          front-end development, and now venturing into backend development to
          build full-stack applications. I&apos;m loving every step of this
          journey and aim to create something valuable while having fun.

          I may not be the most outgoing person, but I&apos;m always up for
          making new friends and having a good chat. Let&apos;s connect and see
          where it takes us. And hey, if you&apos;re looking for someone with my
          skills, check out my resume—I&apos;m currently seeking job or
          internship opportunities.
