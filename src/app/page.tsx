          Hey there! I&apos;m Sameer Jadav, a 19 y/o from India. I like coding,
          VFX, and CGI. I&apos;ve got a real passion for this thing called
          creative coding—it&apos;s like blending art and tech, it&apos;s
          awesome! I also enjoy exploring and figuring things out about myself.

          Not too long ago, I used to spend countless hours watching anime. Then
          one day my friend called me to let me know he was getting himself a
          fancy new laptop! That got me thinking, &quot;Hey, dude, can I have
          your old laptop?&quot; And guess what? He was kind enough to say yes!
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          With this shiny new piece of tech, I decided to ditch the anime binges
          and dive into learning some serious skills. And guess what I stumbled
          upon? Programming, specifically web development. Maybe it&apos;s
          because I started with HTML and CSS—I just loved seeing my creations
          come to life right there in the browser. Now, I&apos;m on a mission to
          create stuff that&apos;s not only impressive but also brings a whole
          lot of joy.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          I may not be the most outgoing person, but I&apos;m always up for
          making new friends and having a good chat. Let&apos;s connect and see
          where it takes us. And hey, if you&apos;re looking for someone with my
          skills, check out my resume—I&apos;m currently seeking job or
          internship opportunities.
