A developer portfolio is a website that displays your work as a developer. However, it's not sufficient to have just a portfolio. As a developer, you need a website that serves as your platform. A developer website is more than just a place to showcase your projects. It's a space where you can share your personal life, thoughts, and ideas through blogs. Your website is one of your most significant projects, but the question remains: why would anyone visit it?

## Why Visit Your Site?

People rarely visit your website just to get to know you, which is why a portfolio alone may not be sufficient for developers. To attract visitors, you need to offer them something of value. This can be achieved by writing blog posts, sharing YouTube videos, or showcasing your projects. I've personally stumbled upon some fantastic projects on people's websites that have inspired me to create something amazing and learn new things. Now that we know why people would visit your website, let's discuss how you can present yourself and provide value to your visitors.

## Winning Over Your Visitors

1. **SEO:** Owning the SEO of your website is one of the best things you can do for yourself, but it's not an easy task. To rank better in searches, you can add SEO meta tags to your website. Adding just the title and description is not enough; you also need to add OG tags, Twitter tags, a robots file, a sitemap, and a `site.webmanifest` file. By doing so, you can squeeze as much juice as possible from SEO. Check out [this website's](https://github.com/SameerJadav/sameerjadav.me/blob/9aba92c3d372c0195dbfa9c22e21e85e519c7c63/src/app/layout.tsx#L29C1-L29C1) SEO to learn more and get an idea of how you can do it.
2. **Blog:** Writing blogs can provide immense value. It helps you become more articulate, and it shows that you know how to write, speak, and communicate. Writing can also help you improve your soft skills, which are essential for efficient work. By sharing your thoughts on any matter or writing technical blogs to share your knowledge, you can engage with the community and demonstrate your programming expertise to potential employers.
3. **Website itself:** Your website is one of the most important projects, and it deserves extra effort. By doing so, you can increase the quality and complexity of your codebase. Other developers will notice this and wonder how you implemented certain features. If your website is open source, they may even check out the website repo. Getting known among other developers is one of the best things you can do. You can make friends who share your interests, collaborate with them, and even get great job opportunities.
