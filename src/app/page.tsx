        <p>
          I am a 19-year-old JavaScript/TypeScript developer who specializes in
          building full-stack applications using Next.js and serverless
          technologies. Currently, I am also exploring Svelte to gain experience
          with different frameworks. Open-source contributions are a significant
          part of my work, as all of my projects are open-source. Additionally,
          I write blogs to enhance my writing skills and become more articulate.

          During my free time, I enjoy watching anime and listening to podcasts
          to expand my knowledge on various topics. Additionally, I make it a
          point to exercise every day and spend some quiet time alone without
          any music or shows to recharge my batteries.
